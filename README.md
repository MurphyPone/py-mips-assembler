# py-mips-assembler

A MIPS assembler written in Python

## Use
`./main.py <input.asm>`
`./main.py -symbols <input.asm>` to write a symbol table

generates the relevant machine code for the valid `<input.asm>`

## TODO 

- improve testing suite
- the address is being set to 0x0 for pseudo commands, but needs to be 0x2000
